AliceVision is a Photogrammetric Computer Vision Framework which provides a 3D
Reconstruction and Camera Tracking algorithms. AliceVision aims to provide
strong software basis with state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms that can
be tested, analyzed and reused. The project is a result of collaboration between
academia and industry to provide cutting-edge algorithms with the robustness and
the quality required for production usage.

Photogrammetry is the science of making measurements from photographs. It infers
the geometry of a scene from a set of unordered photographies or videos.
Photography is the projection of a 3D scene onto a 2D plane, losing depth
information. The goal of photogrammetry is to reverse this process.
